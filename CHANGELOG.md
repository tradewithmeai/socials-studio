# Changelog

This project doesn't yet follow a strict versioning scheme beyond `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH-beta.N` --
that will firm up once it leaves beta. Dates are when a release was tagged, not when work started.

## v0.1.0-beta.2 (2026-08-12)

### Removed from the advertised surface

- **X (Twitter) is no longer presented as a supported platform.** It's out of every public-facing
  doc, table, issue template, and agent-facing tour/quick-reference. This is a documentation and
  discovery change, not a code removal: `auth/publish_x.py` and its login machinery in
  `auth/platforms.py` / `auth/login_wizard.py` are untouched and still fully functional if invoked
  explicitly by platform key. The X-specific onboarding skill and publishing notes were moved to
  `.claude/dormant/` (not deleted) -- see `.claude/dormant/README.md` for the reasoning and how to
  reinstate it in a future release.

### Safety

- **Every publisher is now safe by default.** Previously, calling a `publish_<platform>.py`
  library function or its CLI with no explicit `dry_run` flag would publish for real, immediately
  -- private-by-default visibility on YouTube didn't fix this, since it only helps if you already
  remembered to make it a dry run in the first place. Now, `--confirm-publish` (CLI) or
  `confirm_publish=True` (library call) is required to actually publish anything; everything else,
  including calling with no flags at all, validates only. `--dry-run` remains available as an
  explicit, equivalent way to request validate-only behavior, and always wins if both are passed.
  See `auth/publish_safety.py` and the README's "Publishing safety" section.
- **YouTube uploads now require explicit Made for Kids declaration and upload-terms
  acknowledgment** before a real upload can proceed, per the YouTube API Services Terms of
  Service, Section 9.1. Neither is required for a dry run. See
  `auth/publish_youtube.py`'s module docstring for the exact policy citations.
- **YouTube OAuth scopes were narrowed** to the minimum `doctor.py` and publishing actually use
  (`youtube.upload`, `youtube.readonly`) -- the broad `youtube` manage scope was requested but
  never used by any code path in this repo, and has been dropped. **Existing users must
  re-authorize**: delete `profiles/youtube/token.json` and re-run
  `python -m auth.setup_youtube_oauth`. A token issued under the old scopes will fail on refresh
  with a "scope has changed" error rather than silently keep working.

### Added

- `PRIVACY.md` -- what's stored locally, where, for how long, and why. Linked from the README,
  the website footer, and the YouTube OAuth setup docs.
- A unit test suite (`tests/`) covering every publisher's default-safe behavior, the
  confirm-publish gate, invalid/missing media paths, YouTube's visibility/Made-for-Kids/upload-
  warning handling, and OAuth scope constants. No live credentials, browser profiles, or network
  access required.
- GitHub Actions CI running the test suite and a syntax check across supported Python versions.
- `requirements-dev.txt` for test/lint dependencies, kept separate from runtime dependencies.
- `.claude/skills/openmontage-context/SKILL.md` (carried over from the prior beta.1 development
  cycle, listed here for completeness) -- grounds publish copy in an OpenMontage project's own
  script/brief/render-report artifacts.

### Fixed

- `SECURITY.md` inaccurately claimed there were "no platform API keys or OAuth client
  credentials involved" and that only two files touch a browser or filesystem outside the project
  directory -- both were true when YouTube was the only publisher and false since Bluesky,
  LinkedIn, Instagram, and OAuth-based YouTube publishing were added. Rewritten to describe what's
  actually in the codebase.
- README troubleshooting referred to "no saved YouTube session" -- YouTube has never used a
  browser session; it uses an OAuth token. Corrected to describe the actual failure mode and fix.
- `CLAUDE.md` claimed YouTube was "the only publish path implemented so far" -- stale since
  Bluesky, LinkedIn, and Instagram publishers were added. Corrected.
- The website (`docs/index.html`) linked to the `v0.1.0-beta.1` release tag while `main` had
  diverged with substantially more functionality -- pointed at the repository's releases listing
  instead until beta.2 is actually tagged, so it never sends a visitor to stale code.
- Runtime dependency declarations had no upper bounds. Added major-version ceilings so a future
  breaking release upstream can't silently break this project's install.

## v0.1.0-beta.1 (2026-08-05)

Initial public beta. Login wizard and publishing for YouTube, X, Bluesky, LinkedIn, and Instagram.
